Hi there, I'm Leen 👋

I’m a Master’s student in Translational Medicine with a Bachelor's in Computing Science, specializing in machine learning for healthcare. My research is using AI to forecast blood glucose trajectories using large-scale electronic health records, with the goal of optimizing healthcare operations and improving patient outcomes.

𝗦𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀:

✅ Presented first-author at European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 2025 in Vienna, one of the world's largest medical conferences.

✅ Front-end dev: Built an e-commerce website in React for Zero RampUp.

✅ Back-end dev: Django APIs for a distributed social platform.

✅ Computer vision: YOLOv5 / U-Net for detection & segmentation in addition to Detectron2 for autonomous vehicle navigation; deployment with Docker.

𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 & 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀:

Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, React, Django, Docker, Git; MongoDB, PostgreSQL.

I’m excited about roles where data science meets practical deployment—collaborating with experts like clinicians and engineers to turn models into measurable impact.
