I'm an aspiring Software Developer in my fourth year of computing science at the University of Alberta. 
You can visit my portfolio website (https://leenzebdeh.github.io/) to learn more about my work! Here are a few examples:

✅ Collaborated in a 7-member team to develop and deploy a business website for Zero RampUp using JavaScript. <br>
✅ Worked as a Django backend developer to create a social network platform web app that is linked with other teams’  unique APIs and can aggregate activity from their web servers. <br>
✅ Trained, tuned, and deployed various machine learning models with PyTorch and TensorFlow. <br>
✅ Customized ML models, such as YOLOv5 and U-Net, to perform object detection and image segmentation. <br>
✅ Experienced in AI and reinforcement learning algorithms, including A* search, Q-learning, and heuristic search. <br>
✅ Developed and tested an Android social media app as a developer in a collaborative Scrum environment.

𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 & 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀: React, Python, Java, Android, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker & AI technologies!

I get excited about opportunities where I'm able to work with highly creative people to develop innovative solutions using the latest technology.

My Interests: Cooking new cuisines (currently most interested in Korean cuisine), Reading (currently reading Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark and my favourite is Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky).
